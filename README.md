Boilerplate Readme
=========

Taken (with love) from Dan Abramov's awesome [react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)

but tweaked to personal preference. 

get started by installing dependencies via

```
npm i --dev
```

then start with:

```
npm start
```
